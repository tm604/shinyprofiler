# What is Shiny? #

Shiny is a **lightning fast**, fully documented and by far the-easiest-to-use-ever C/C++/Lua high-performance profiler with no extensive surgery for your existing projects. Results are smoothed and shown in run-time as a call-tree or sorted-by-time. Output is also renderable as graphs in Ogre3D and easily customized to any other graphics engine!

  * Very very **low overhead**, extremely powerful and accurate high speed profiling
  * Amazingly **simple-to-use & flexible** interface with lots of examples and docs
  * Results are elegantly shown as **call-graph** or sorted-by-time and readable in run-time code
  * On-the-fly smoothing **averages** for scientific or main-loop projects like game engines
  * Rendering **history graphs** & nicely colored output in OGRE 3D or your custom engine
  * Clean platform-independent, object-oriented and free-for-any-purpose source code
